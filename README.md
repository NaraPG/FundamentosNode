# Node.js
## This repository
> In this course we learn about what Node.js is and some basic concepts to understand how it works and what uses does it have.

## Introduction
#### What is Node.js?
> Node.js is a platform built on Chrome's JavaScript runtime for easily building fast and scalable network applications. Node.js uses an event-driven, non-blocking I/O model that makes it lightweight and efficient, perfect for data-intensive real-time applications that run across distributed devices.

#### What is nodemon?
> nodemon is a tool that helps develop node. js based applications by automatically restarting the node application when file changes in the directory are detected.

## Main Content
> - An `environment variable` is a variable whose value is set outside the program, typically through functionality built into the operating system or microservice.
> - `HTTP` is a protocol which allows the fetching of resources, such as HTML documents.
> - `Callbacks`: In JavaScript, a callback is a function passed into another function as an argument to be executed later.
> - `Promises`:A promise is an object that may produce a single value some time in the future: either a resolved value, or a reason that it’s not resolved. A
> promise may be in one of 3 possible states: 
>    * Fulfilled 
>    * Rejected
>    * Pending.
> - `Async/Await`: Is the extension of promises which we get as a support in the language.
> - Node.js includes `fs` module to access physical `file system`. The `fs` module is responsible for all the asynchronous or synchronous file I/O operations.
> - `Module` in Node.js is a simple or complex functionality organized in single or multiple JavaScript files which can be reused throughout the Node.js application.

## Where to Use Node.js?
> Following are the areas where Node.js is proving itself as a perfect technology partner.
> - I/O bound Applications
> - Data Streaming Applications
> - Data Intensive Real-time Applications (DIRT)
> - JSON APIs based Applications
> - Single Page Applications

## Dependencies
> - Install [VS Code](https://code.visualstudio.com/download)
> - Install [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/en/)
> - Install nodemon
>   * Cloning with git or by using npm (the recommended way):
> ```
> npm install -g nodemon
> ```
>   * You can also install nodemon as a development dependency:
>   ```
>   npm install --save-dev nodemon
>   ```

## Run Code
> You can only run this project by file, using the extension [Code Runner](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=formulahendry.code-runner) then select the code and use left click and `Run Code` . Now you'll see the code running in the terminal.
